Test 1: Puzzle 3
Shirov v. Miladinovic, Belgrade 1995

Black has scattered pawns but these are accompanied by the bishop pair.  Time to clamp down?  

White to play.


Black undefended pieces include a6 & Qc7.
Weak squares include most of the black squares

Could trade pawns Qxa6, Bxb2.
Defensive b3.

An interesting tactic move Nc5 to attack Bd7, a6 & e6.
If the bishop moves, Nxa6 forks queen and rook.
So, black will want to trade the bishop while defending a6.  Probably with Ra8 since using the queen on either a7 or b6 would put it in the line of the white bishop, which seems risky.  But if this is exposed by Nxd7, the queen can recapture from a7, but not b6. 


White has undefended Na4 and Re4.




Test 1: Puzzle 4
McDonald v. Lukacs, Budapest 1995

White to play.

c5 knight fine (?) but better outpost would enable 
white to tie down opponent before launching minority attack



Why is c5 knight fine?  It is under attack, and tieing down queen.

Can offer trade of knight for bishop on e5, pawn kicks f6 knight.  Which only helps black develop knight and open diagonal for queen, so no good.  To oppose f6 knight, I want to move Bf3.  But this is not the question of the puzzle.

I could attack the e6 bishop with Nf4.  Trade on c4 seems fine.  Trade on exf4 seems fine, and rook can take e file.  Also not question of puzzle.

It seems like point of the puzzle is to bet Nc5.  The prerequisite is to remove the dark bishop from the diagonal.  The only piece I can get on that diagonal besides the knight is f4.  Then I have two defenders against one attacker, so I could keep the square after the trade.
