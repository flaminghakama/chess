{[%mdl 32769]} {Now let's examine the mechanism by which the stronger side can
exploit the distant opposition. It is, in fact, quite simple, and consists of
the conversion of the distant opposition into close opposition by means of
outflanking. If outflanking is not possible, then possession of the distant
opposition is worthless. The pawns are lost, after which Black's king will
control the key squares in front of the f7-pawn. But White has a tactical
resource at hand: he moves both pawns forward to lure Black's pawn nearer to
his king allowing him to defend the new key squares.} 1. g6 $1 fxg6 2. f5 $1 (

controls the distant opposition, but he cannot convert it into close
opposition. The problem is that after 2...Kg5 3 Kf1, outflanking with 3...Kh4
has no point; and on 3...Kf4(g4), it is White who takes the close opposition
by 4 Kf2(g2), and Black's king can't use the f5-square as it blocked by his
own pawn. If the king and the pawn could both occupy this square
simultaneously, then on the next move the outflanking would be decisive;
unfortunately, the rules of chess don't allow such a thing.} *
